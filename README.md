## Description

This repository contains MATLAB code for quantifying escape behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster triggered by a predator-mimicking passing shadow stimulus. The code identifies the response type based on walking speed calculation. The speed is calculated using the recorded x and y coordinates, as well as timestamps.
The MATLAB function ‘Main_Drosophila_Behaviour’ produces the figures presented in the study titled "Altered Reactivity to Threatening Stimuli in Drosophila Models of Parkinson's Disease Revealed by a Trial-based Assay" by Kajtor et al.
